<h4>A garden long, long ago and far, far away</h4>
<p>In the beginning, everything was perfect. Two people walking through the most beautiful garden, sun shining, birds chiping...beautiful weather and gorgeous scenery all around. But shelfishness got in the way and ruined the perfect setting. Sin had entered the world that God had created. Eden was no longer perfect. There was now a need for redemption.</p>

<h4>A history of mistakes</h4>
<p>Over the next several hundred years, people did as they pleased. Some were faithful and seeking after God. Many sought their own ways, none of which would get them back to the place of perfection they heard about for generations.</p>

<h4>A coming redemption foretold</h4>
<p>As years progressed, kings came and went. No one in their own power could ever pay for their own sins or the transgressions of others. Sacrifices were required. Through it all, prophets foretold of a coming Savior who would forgive the sins of the world and bring hope of the original perfection of Eden.</p>

<h4>Away in a Manger</h4>
<p>Truly the familiar carol tells it best, "
Away in a manger no crib for a bed.
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay.
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay."
A Savior was born! Fulfilling every prophecy that had been told - his birthplace, his first visits, his family. This was no coincidence. It was a miracle.

<h4>An extraordinary child</h4>
<p>Indeed this was no ordinary child. He was a child like the rest of us, but the son of God. Set apart but living among the world. He was perfect. Finally the only person who could forgive the sins of the world. Like the centuries before, many continued in their own ways and didn't believe the Messiah talked about was finally here. Jesus performed many miraculous signs, taught truth, lived generously and loved greater than anyone else that has ever lived or ever will.</p>

<h4>A time of uncertainty</h4>
<p>Yet while everything seemed hopeful, things weren't always the best. The many that didn't see a need to believe didn't want to hear they had sin and needed to trust in this Jesus. This man who was going against their laws and acting as if he had the right to do it. So to put an end to it, they plotted to have him killed. An innocent man left to suffer and die. Then it was finished.</p>

<h4>A glorious hope</h4>
<p> Prophecy was fulfilled! Sins were now forgiven! The hope that was taught became a reality! Jesus arose from the grave defeating death and defeating sin for the whole world. Thus the free gift of salvation through grace became available to the whole world. Nothing to earn it and nothing to keep us from it as long as we put our faith in God the Creator and his son, Jesus the Savior. One day perfection will be realized in heaven when those who chose to accept the free gift will join together praising God forever.</p>

<h4>A choice remains</h4>
<p>If heaven exists for those who believe, what is left for those who don't? The sad reality is eternity separate from perfection is what remains. An dark and tortuous existence so far removed from anything we've ever experienced. While choosing Christ may not change our circumstances, it changes our hearts and brings hope of what's ahead. The best things in life on this earth are the best you'll ever see if you choose to not accept God's gracious gift. It's a choice and it's up to you to make.</p>
<h4>This is my story and it can be yours too</h4>

<footer>As someone who accepts this free gift, I feel called to share with others. I have prayed for opportunities to be more bold in sharing a message of hope and redemption from the broken world we live in. I'm always willing to talk more if you have questions.</footer>
